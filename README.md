Our Project is mainly focussed on the current situation around the globe.
The Problem we chose is how do innovative students or employees make their game changing ideas into reality in this tough times. It's always tough to find a proper partner or a team to collaborate and build our ideas to reality in online mode.
Switching between several apps to manage a team is a real problem. 
So we came up with a proper solution brainstorming in all the best possible ways & named it as COLLAB.
We tried to follow and execute all the UX rules, & designed a proper high fidelity design.

Let us know your views and feedback on it. Thank you for your time.
